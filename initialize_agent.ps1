# Gemini Autonomous Agent Initializer Script
#
# Function:
# 1. Runs 'tree' command to save the current file structure to 'workspace_state.txt'
# 2. Combines instructions and file structure to create a master prompt
# 3. Sends the master prompt to Gemini to generate the initial plan 'plan.json'
#
# Prerequisites:
# - 'copilot-instructions.md' must exist in the same directory.
# - 'tree' and 'gemini' commands must be executable.
#
# Usage:
# - Run './initialize_agent.ps1' in PowerShell.

You are a fully autonomous software agent. Without asking for user permission, complete the task based on the following instructions and the current workspace state.

# Instructions

Based on the information above, output a concrete series of steps to complete the task as a JSON array. Each step must include a 'type' ('execute_command' or 'generate_code') and a 'payload' (the details of the command to execute or the code to generate).

Example:
[
  { "type": "execute_command", "payload": "pip install beautifulsoup4 selenium" },
  { "type": "generate_code", "payload": { "prompt": "Create a Python function that scrapes an X post. It should take a URL as an argument and return the post's body text.", "file": "src/scraper.py" } },
  { "type": "execute_command", "payload": "python -m unittest discover tests" }
]
